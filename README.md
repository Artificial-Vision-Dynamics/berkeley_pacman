# What is this?
- This is an updated version (from python2 to python3) of the [Berkeley Pacman](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html) project. Its nearly 1-to-1 so you should be able to follow along with their general ideas.

# How do I get this code to run?

All the setup instructions inside `documentation/SETUP.md`

# What are the important files?

- `main/` contains all the code, however you can ignore many of the python files
- `main/search.py` is where all your search algorithms should be.
- `main/searchAgents.py` is where all of your agents should be.

# What commands are there?

As soon as you run the setup, it will show you all the main commands, but here's a quick overview. `run pacman` and `run autograder` will be the most common, and both are just a wrapper calling `cd ./main;python pacman.py` or `cd ./main;python autograder.py` so you can run them manually if you want.
